# Automatic Pothole and Speed Breaker Detection and Alert System in Bangladesh

Road accidents caused by potholes and speed breakers are a significant problem in Bangladesh, resulting in human casualties and economic losses. The proposed solution is an automatic pothole and speed breaker detection and alert system that uses machine learning algorithms to identify hazards and generate alerts for drivers. The system is lowcost and easily deploy-able, making it accessible to all vehicle owners. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through experiments, which demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce road accidents caused by potholes and speed breakers. The proposed system's use of machine learning algorithms for road safety applications is both original and significant. The thesis is useful for vehicle manufacturers, road safety authorities, and researchers working in the field of road safety. The practical, theoretical, ethical, and societal consequences of the thesis include the potential to reduce human casualties, economic losses, and traffic congestion in Bangladesh. The system's ability to detect hazards with high accuracy and alert drivers in a timely manner is evaluated using various parameters, including precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the proposed system can significantly improve road safety by reducing the number of accidents caused by potholes and speed breakers. The proposed solution is a significant contribution to the field of road safety and can be easily installed on any vehicle. The system's accessibility to all vehicle owners makes it a practical solution for improving road safety in Bangladesh. Overall, the thesis presents a valuable solution to mitigate the problem of road accidents caused by potholes and speed breakers.
